## ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Q2â€“Q3 2025)

- [x] Finalize GCAI mission, model, and hybrid structure (nonprofit + for-profit)
- [x] Create GitHub repository and core documentation (README, License, Code of Conduct)
- [ ] Register GCAI legally under a suitable jurisdiction
- [ ] Publish first whitepaper and policy brief
- [ ] Establish early partnerships and advisory board
- [ ] Launch official **GCAI website** to centralize project information
- [ ] Begin setting up physical **office workspace** for operations

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Prototype Development (Q3â€“Q4 2025)

- [ ] Design core architecture for GCAI simulation engine
- [ ] Integrate global datasets (text, audio, video, social media, open-source intelligence)
- [ ] Build and test initial models (ML/LLMs) for predictive simulations
- [ ] Simulate 2â€“3 regional case studies (Africa, Middle East, Eastern Europe)
- [ ] Incorporate de-biasing mechanisms across model layers
- [ ] Expand GCAI website with interactive platform demos and research sections

---

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Community & Platform Expansion (Q1â€“Q2 2026)

- [ ] Launch GCAI Community Engagement Program (NGOs, think tanks, researchers)
- [ ] Expand open-source documentation and public datasets
- [ ] Deploy simulation visualizations with conflict-prevention recommendations
- [ ] Develop partnerships with academic institutions and government bodies
- [ ] Secure grant and philanthropic funding for scale-up

---

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Global Deployment & Policy Integration (Late 2026+)

- [ ] Release full platform to governments, international organizations, and peacekeeping units
- [ ] Build enterprise/API offerings for B2B clients (NGOs, think tanks, public agencies)
